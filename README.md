ðŸš€ Project Launch: Amazon Clone using HTML & CSS! ðŸš€

Excited to share my latest project â€“ an Amazon clone built using just HTML and CSS! ðŸŽ‰

The project is divided into three main sections:

Header: Contains the logo, navigation bar with search functionality, and user account options.

Main Content: Showcases product categories, individual product listings, and promotional banners.

Footer: Includes links to customer service, policies, and social media handles.

This project provided a great opportunity to refine my skills in front-end development, focusing on structure and styling, and ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout across all devices. The use of external libraries like Font Awesome and Google Fonts helped enhance the visual appeal and functionality.
